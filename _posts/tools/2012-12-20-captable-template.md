We typically use this cap table template to do scenario planning with startups to help explore and attempt to answer a variety of questions. What will the founder & early employee equity split be? How much will you raise from friends & family? What will your next round / valuation be? 

This template was created by [Ed Levinson](https://twitter.com/edlevinson), an angel investor, advisor, and all around startup expert in Vancouver.

* Mark Longo, a great Vancouver-based startup tech lawyer with [LaBarge Weinstein](http://www.lwlaw.com/people/longo-mark/), helped give a presentation that is a great backgrounder for cap tables: [Founder Agreements, Cap Tables, & Valuations (PDF)](https://docs.google.com/a/fullstack.ca/file/d/0B72cQ_t3lduXUW5LM2daSkRtenM/edit)
