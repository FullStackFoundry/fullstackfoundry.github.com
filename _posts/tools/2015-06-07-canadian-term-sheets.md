I'm super inspired by [Bryce of Indie.vc open sourcing his term sheets](http://bryce.vc/post/120533439475/indie-vc-termsheets-on-github), so it's about time that I posted the Full Stack term sheets, too.

I've taken a couple of attempts at working together with other groups in Canada to release a true universal set of seed financing documents, much as the US has a handful of similar packages of documents to choose from. But, there hasn't been an interest in moving particularly quickly. I've always shared these documents as examples -- for both founders & funders -- so it only makes sense to fully open source them. We completed over a dozen financings in a 2 year period, with 9 companies. About half of them were common stock deals using this term sheet.

You can find a [web version][webcommonseed] and a [PDF][pdfcommonseed] of the Full Stack Common Seed in the resources folder, as well as the "source" document [in the Github repo][ghcommonseed] that contains this website.

We also have a convertible debt term sheet that we've used, but increasingly I'm convinced that convertible debt is not the right method for early stage financing, so I won't be sharing it for now.

Everything in the resources folder is free to use, licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal.
