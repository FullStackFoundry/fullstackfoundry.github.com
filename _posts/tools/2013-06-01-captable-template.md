We typically use this cap table template to do scenario planning with startups to help explore and attempt to answer a variety of questions. What will the founder & early employee equity split be? How much will you raise from friends & family? What will your next round / valuation be? 

This template was created by [Ed Levinson](https://twitter.com/edlevinson), an angel investor, advisor, and all around startup expert in Vancouver.
