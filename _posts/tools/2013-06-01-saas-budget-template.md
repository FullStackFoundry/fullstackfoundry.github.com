Christoph Janz of Point Nine Capital wrote a [great post on financial planning for SaaS startups](http://christophjanz.blogspot.ca/2012/03/financial-planning-for-saas-startups.html). We recommend using this template as a way for startups to model their budget / costs (especially headcount) as part of discussing the use of proceeds over a 12 - 18 month period. Our _Budgie_ app will walk you through filling it out.

Most of the companies we work with have no or very limited funding, and we are often investing in a pre-seed round. Regardless, use this tool to understand your costs - what will you be spending on, and what will your customer base be at over a one year time frame.

There are other rules of thumb. For instance, we typically want to see that founders are paying themselves a moderate salary – typically $4K - $5K per month.
