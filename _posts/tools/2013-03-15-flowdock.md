Flowdock is a group chat system that means you can ask those quick questions without having to add another email to the inbox. As well, it aggregates git commits, Twitter posts, and basically anything around team project management and software development. It even bridges to IRC, so you can continue to use your favourite IRC tools but bring in the <acronym title="Dumb Business Guys">DBGs</acronym>, too.
