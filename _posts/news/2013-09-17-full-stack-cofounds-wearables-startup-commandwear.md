<p class="intro">Full Stack is pleased to announced that we have funded and co-founded [CommandWear][web]. CommandWear is focused on developing wearable tech for the global public safety and security market.</p>

[Lance Tracey][lance-al] has worked with [Mike Morrow][mike-al], CEO and Founder of CommandWear, in the past. When Mike came to us at Full Stack and explained his vision for taking wearable tech into the safety and crisis management industry, we were intrigued.

Here was a great founder with strong sales and business development skills, with existing customer relationships, and a big idea he wanted to take to market. We've been looking for founders where the Full Stack team can move beyond value-add external advice and roll up our sleeves and help take a new company to market directly. Mike and CommandWear are a great fit for this, and we look forward to building a great company together.

We see a developing wave of wearable tech – from heads up displays, to commodity tablets, to bracelets and sensors of all kinds – coming into the market. The hardware will iterate very quickly, and CommandWear intends to specialize in the end-to-end software stack and user experience of select vertical markets.

We believe that the commodification of custom hardware coupled with a strong software ecosystem around connected devices makes it possible to roll out solutions to vertical markets at a much lower initial cost than was previously possible. CommandWear intends to initially be hardware agnostic – Linux and Android, plus Bluetooth LE for external sensor modules, will be a kind of compatibility layer that provides commonality across devices.

There are interesting challenges around devices, including intermittent connectivity, peer-to-peer connectivity, storage & sync of mission critical data, and even remote firmware updates of connected devices in the field. CommandWear is actively speaking with early adopter customers to identify their biggest pain points, and help fill capability gaps for real-time connected information flow in the field.

We'll have more to announce in the coming weeks. To stay up to date, sign up for the [CommandWear launch list][web], follow the [CommandWear blog][blog], and check out the [job opportunities on Angel List][jobs].
