<p class="intro">We're very happy to share that Full Stack is part of Victoria-based Kiind's current round of funding. [Kiind][k] is a gift platform that is pioneering "waste free" gift giving, by enabling gift givers to only pay when the gift is redeemed. This is our second investment in a Vancouver Island based team, after the Input Logic team in Nanaimo.</p>

We've known co-founder [Leif Baradoy][leif] for quite some time, and always been impressed by his hustle. It's our pleasure to work more closely with him, co-founder [Peter Locke][peter], and the rest of the Kiind team.

Kiind is shaking up the gift card industry that has been firmly routed in a particular way of doing business, as well as firmly in the offline, physical card based world. By creating a platform with solid APIs that connect to many different gifting providers - including large global brands such as Amazon, Apple, and Gap - Kiind is able to power a number of different gifting solutions.

Kiind is also great for gifting digital & ecommerce gifts, such as an [Rdio subscriptions](http://www.kiind.me/viewGiftMarketplace/gift/95/435) or [purchases from AllPosters.com](http://www.kiind.me/viewGiftMarketplace/gift/38/216).

The team at Kiind have done a great job with [press coverage](https://angel.co/kiind/activity#press), including their recent [TechCrunch article for the launch of their API](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/29/kiind-launches-api-for-its-digital-gift-card-platform/) and the [Globe & Mail article about the Canadian retailers they've added in time for Christmas](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/starting-out/buy-now-pay-later-gift-cards-come-to-canada/article15820406/).

Right now, Kiind is focused on enabling corporate giving, building out their API, and specific vertical solutions such as real estate brokerages.
