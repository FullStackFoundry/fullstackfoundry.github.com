<p class="intro">This week Full Stack is announcing its fifth investment of the year, Donde.<br />
<br />
Donde is a mobile store locator for brands and chains that helps surface information on the growing trend of clicks to bricks. By using Donde, companies can not only direct online visitors to their physical locations, but also start to surface information about which online promotions drive foot traffic, and to which stores.</p>

[Donde][donde] has a long relationship with the Full Stack team. Co-founder [Anthony Nicalo][anthony] was part of Bootup Labs, co-founded by Boris Mann, as Foodtree. Anthony joined forces with his co-founder and CTO [Fabien][fabien] and started selling to a wider, non-food focused customer base, including [Native Shoes][native]. The Donde technology was spun out of Foodtree into a separate company, and joined Cincinnati-based accelerator, The Brandery. 

[The Brandery][brandery] is a very interesting focused accelerator. Cincinnati is home to the headquarters to P&G. This in turn means that a number of global design & marketing agencies have a presence in Cincinnati. For teams joining The Brandery, this grants a high level of access & exposure to customers interested in marketing technology of all kinds. 

For Full Stack, funding Canadian entrepreneurs that get accepted into top tier US accelerators is a great way to help support founders. 

Congrats to Anthony, Fabien, & the entire Donde team for a great Demo Day. Find out more & connect with Donde on Twitter [@Donde][d-tw] and on Angel List at [angel.co/donde][d-al]
