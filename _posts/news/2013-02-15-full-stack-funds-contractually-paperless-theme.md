<p class="intro">Full Stack is pleased to announce that we have funded <a href="http://www.contractual.ly">Contractually</a>. Contractually lets you simplify your contracts process, enabling you to create, negotiate and e-sign your contracts online.</p>

Both [Boris Mann](http://angel.co/borismann) and [Lance Tracey](https://angel.co/elty-1) are previous investors in Contractually, and believe in founder [Martin Ertl's](https://angel.co/martinertl) vision of taking legal documents paperless, improving workflow, and creating efficiencies for the new breed of digital businesses.

The paperless theme is an interesting one. Many businesses believe that by using Word docs, PDFs, and email, that they've gone paperless. But paperless is about truly embracing the digital nature of information. Automating the input of data, using APIs to flow data between systems, and creating new end-to-end flows that never assume print as output.

Contractually is exploring this theme in the context of contracts and other important business & legal documents.

The Full Stack investment will allow Contractually to improve the core experience of creating & signing documents, as well as expand the platform to work with a number of enterprise use cases.
