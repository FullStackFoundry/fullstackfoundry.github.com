Quantified Self is an exploding space right now, with new apps, trackers and techniques coming out every week. But with all of these technologies becoming more available, what will actually make people use them? How will we get value? What are the key innovations and changes that need to happen before Quantified Self becomes mainstream? We are going to get together to discuss this, and hear from some people that are trying to tackle this challenge.
